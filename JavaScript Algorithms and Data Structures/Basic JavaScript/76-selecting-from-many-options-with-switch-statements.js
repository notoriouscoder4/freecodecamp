/*
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. 
A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. 
Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("The fruit is an apple");
    break;
  case "orange":
    console.log("The fruit is an orange");
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. 
If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - alpha
2 - beta
3 - gamma
4 - delta
*/

/* 
function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
*/

function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch(val) {
    case 1:
      answer = "alpha";
      break;
    case 2:
      answer = "beta";
      break;
    case 3:
      answer = "gamma";
      break;
    case 4:
      answer = "delta";
      break;
  }


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
